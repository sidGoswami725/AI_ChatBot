# Character Chatbot
[DALL-BOT(Deployment link)](https://ai-chatbot-1-h7qz.onrender.com)

A Flask-based interactive chatbot application that lets users engage in conversations with AI-powered characters through text or voice inputs.

## Overview

This project features four distinct AI charactersâ€”Jax, Victor, Lila, and Eliasâ€”each with their own personality, backstory, and tone. Users can chat with them by recording audio or typing text, with responses generated in real-time and delivered via synthesized speech. The app supports multiple languages, stores conversation history in Firebase, and includes audio processing enhancements for a natural experience.


### Characters
- *Jax "Wildcard" Carter*: A sarcastic comedian who roasts users while providing helpful answers.
- *Victor Graves*: A blunt ex-military strategist who gives no-nonsense advice.
- *Lila Moreau*: A flirtatious ex-private investigator who charms while assisting.
- *Elias Sterling*: A wise mentor offering thoughtful, practical guidance.

## Featuresâœ¨
- *Voice Input*: Record audio with voice activity detection and noise reduction.
- *Transcription*: Convert audio to text using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text.
- *Text-to-Speech*: Generate natural-sounding responses with Google Cloud TTS, enhanced with prosody and character-specific effects.
- *Multilingual Support*: Supports languages like English, Hindi, Tamil, French, and more.
- *Conversation History*: Stored in Firebase Firestore and synced per user IP and character.
- *Audio Storage*: Uploaded to Firebase Storage with public URLs for playback.
- *Character Personalities*: Responses generated via Gemini API with unique character prompts.

## Setup
Follow these detailed steps to set up the Character Chat Application on your local machine:

### 1. Prerequisites ðŸ“‹
- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- Firebase account with Firestore & Storage configured
- Google Cloud API access for Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech
- OpenAI API Key (if using OpenAI models)

### 2. Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/character-chatbot.git  
cd character-chatbot  

Install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  


### 3. Environment Variables
Create a .env file and add the required API keys:

API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key  
FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS=path/to/your/firebase-credentials.json  
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-firebase-bucket-name  
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-google-cloud-project  

### 5. Set Up Google Cloud Credentials
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).

   - Create a project or use an existing one.
   - Enable the Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech APIs:
     - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library."
     - Search for and enable "Cloud Speech-to-Text API" and "Cloud Text-to-Speech API."
   - Create a service account:
     - Go to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts."
     - Click "Create Service Account," name it (e.g., `character-chat`), and grant it "Editor" role.
     - Generate a JSON key and download it (e.g., `google-credentials.json`).
   - Place the JSON file in your project directory and update `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` in `.env` with its path.


### 6. Set Up Firebase
   - Visit [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).

   - Create a new project (e.g., `character-chat-app`).
   - Enable Firestore and Storage:
     - Go to "Firestore Database" > "Create Database" (start in test mode for simplicity).
     - Go to "Storage" > "Get Started" and set up default rules.
   - Generate a service account key:
     - Go to "Project Settings" > "Service Accounts."
     - Click "Generate new private key" and download the JSON (e.g., `firebase-credentials.json`).
   - Place the JSON in your project directory and update `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` in `.env`.
   - Copy your storage bucket name from "Storage" (e.g., `your-project-id.appspot.com`) and set it as `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`.


### 7. Obtain a Gemini API Key

   - Sign up for access to the Gemini API (check the providerâ€™s official site for details).
   - Generate an API key and add it to `.env` as `API_KEY`.


### 8. Install FFmpeg

     - FFmpeg is required for audio conversion. Install it based on your OS:
     - On macOS:
     brew install ffmpeg

   #### - On Ubuntu:
   
      sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
   
   #### - On Windows:
   - Download from [FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
   
       - Extract and add the `bin` folder to your system PATH (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`).
       - Verify installation:
       ffmpeg -version
   

### 9. Verify Setup


    - Ensure all dependencies are installed (`pip list` should show `flask`, `google-cloud-speech`, etc.).
   - Check that `.env` is correctly configured and service account JSONs are accessible.


### Running the Application

### 1. Start the Flask Server

   python app.py
   The app runs on `http://localhost:5003`.

### 2. Access the Web Interface
   
   - Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5003`.
   - Select a character from the sidebar.

### 3. Interact with Characters

   - Voice Input: Click the microphone button to record (up to 10 seconds).
   - Text Input: Type a message and click send.
   - Select a language from the dropdown.

### 4.  View Conversation History
   
   - Messages and audio responses appear in the chat window.

### 5. Clear Chat

   - Click "Clear Chat" to reset the conversation.

### Notes
- Grant microphone permissions in your browser for voice input.
- Audio files in static/audio/ are temporary and cleaned up after upload.
- IP-based conversation separation may not work in shared networks.
- Some voices (e.g., Chirp3-HD) may not support SSML; plain text is used as a fallback.

## API Endpoints
- **/** - Home page 
- **/<character>** - Chat page for a specific character 
- **/process_audio** - Handles voice input 
- **/process_text** - Handles text input 

### Troubleshooting
- Transcription Fails: Verify Google Cloud credentials and audio file.
- TTS Errors: Check language code and voice in tts.py.
- Firebase Issues: Confirm service account permissions and bucket setup.
- No Audio Output: Ensure FFmpeg is installed and in PATH.
